A game I enjoyed playing is Super Mario Party. I enjoy the battle between family or friends to roll higher and get farther on the gameboard. I liked the aspect of adding in mini games at the end of each round to compete between players. I also liked how some of the maps were based off of old nitendo games.

I think the main thing that was unclear was whether or not we were able to keep the file public or private and still have you able to check the journal.

A task that computer science comes into play in during my daily routine is waking up in the morning. The way I wake up every morning is by my alarm on my phone going off. By setting my alarm to go off at a certain time and make a certain noice is all created from a line of code built into the phone. With this code I am able to start my day on time and do what I need to.

A career pathway that interests me is cyber security. My main responsibilities would be to stop any attacks or threats towards my companies computer software and network. The main skills needed to work in cyber security is problem solving, adaptability, risk management, and critical thinking. The main education needed is a bachelor's degree in cyber security. This job aligns with my interests and goals due to the fact of wanting to improve my coding skills and also wanting to eventually be able to know how to easily solve problems.

Coding can improve problem solving skills due to the fact that in order to be good at coding, you must know what to do or how to fix any problems that happen in your code. This can be a useful skill because in life there are always problems that we face and need to know how to solve. Understanding coding can help in other pathways because of how many different types of skills that are useful in any job.

Ai is useful due to many different factors. One of the main factors is its ability to find solutions to many different types of problems. AI is able to find solutions for any type of problems and come up with more creative solutions that would take a whole team of people to come up with. This makes it easier to come up with solutions and solve problems faster.

Some potentials risk of AI is people overusing it. Ai is helpful in many ways so students may see it as an easy way to get work done with minimal effort. This can be harmful to a students ability to learn. This could also turn students to become lazy when it comes to school and not put in the work or effort they are capable of doing.

Technology has made food more affordable and accessable to the public due to how much more food can be grown at onced compared to if it was just people doing it on there own. With technology, we have the ability to plant more food and be able to harvest more at once, then deliver it to grocery stores. This makes it easier for the average public to be able to get the food they need to survive.

I think VR can impact and currently impacts people lives based on the different programs available to the public. With the many new developments in not only coding but with the different programs used withing VR, VR has impacted more people lives. The main example of this is with the different games or programs for working out or getting excercise. There are so many programs that make getting excersise easier to stay motivated and have fun with the workout. Something that excites me with VR is what else is to come to it and how much more it will impact our daily lives. An ethical consideration that would need to be addressed would be on whether having the headset on for so long is as good for our health as it is, even if we are using it for a program that helps you workout.

Yes, I am looking foward to winter break and the holidays.


# January 9th, 2025

Something I enjoyed from last semester was the lessons and the research I would do for the different journal entries. There isn't anything specific I would like to earn. I am not interested in any particular certification.


# January 17th, 2025

I think this shift could be a good or a bad thing. I do think AI will enhance productivity and enhance limits but could alsolimit them for AI being able to do more things than humans can. I would prepare myself to be able to be flexible with things changing.

I think the government uses this data collected by citizens to solve different nationwide problems as they see fit. They might also use the data within major brands and companies to see exact;y what consumers like. Both of these reasons are the main reason I believe that companies or the government should have access to peoples dats. Any other reason wouldnt be something I see as a prioity within having peoples data.
I think companies, such as tiktok, could continue running globally by creating more security measures. These measures would be to properly insure that peoples data arent being used in ways that we would not approve of. They can do this by creating some kind of system to ensure that the data the app has access to won't be spread around. This would also ensure that the app doesn't have any data that was not shared woth the app in the first place or that the consumer doesnt know about it.

Technology can provide safety and help in aviation when flying by doing many different things. A main way is with navigation especialy when finding a certain location or just traveling. Navigation helpps a pilot figure out where they need to go and how to get there. Having this technology not only makes a pilot job easier with finding the fastest way to get somehwere, but they can also use this to find the safeest way especially with the amount of fuel they have at once.
Another important way technology helps is communication while in the air. Being able to communicate with towers and the main control tower to find out if anything is affecting the travel pathway, and also weather. Knowing what is happening on land while being in the air can help ensure the safety of not only yourslef but the people on land as well. Making sure that there is a safe place to land and that something doesn't appeasr that you arent aware of appears in your travel path is important if you want to stay safe. The technology used to communicate between you and the people on land could be one of the most important pieces of technology available when traveling in the air.

Something interesting I learned is how music and movies can effect people in different ways. Certain songs can get people to go farther than they ever been before especially when running. Along with this certain movies can make people realize something they went through was not normal.

Over spring break I mainly used Social media like TikTok and Instagram. I used these to entertain myself, talk to friends, and do research on future careers.For the most part I was texting friends and just talking to differen people to see how their break was going. I used instagram and the internet to get information about the military.
I mainly was reserching what opportunities I would have with the Army and what I need to do to get ready for basic. This example shows how the problem solving skills used in coding can be used with different kinds of techknowlegy. I was able to use the internet to answer question I had about the pathway I want to take in life career wise.

I believe that Ai-Driven predictions add onto the excitements when trying to predict who the winner is. I believe that this not only makes the game more unpredictable due to the fact that sometimes AI gets there predictions worng and they end up predicting the opposite of what they want. Along with this factor, it makes the stakes higher due tto people using AI predictions as a way on how they want to bet money or similar types of betting. Lastly, these can create friendly competeitons between friends or coulleugs based on who they vote for or bet against using the AI program.
The roles that not only social media, but also streaming services play is makes these games and events available to more people all over the world. These tools let people that live hours away be able to experience the fun adn excitement of the game as if they were actually there. Along with this, they are able to see more events and more thing that are happening at the same time all from the safety and comfort of their home. Lastly, many fans have lives and responsibilities they aren't able to leave behind no matte rhow big of a fan they are. With social media and streaming seervices, it gives them the opportunity to enjoy the events while still being able to take care of the people or things that need to be taken care of.

I think and AI tutor would be helpful to many people. I think this would be a good way for many people ,especially those whoe don't like to ask for help, to find a way that works for them in order to sharpen up on certain subjects or even learn something new. Along with this, the AI program could learn to adapt to a way that fits best for each individual person. The AI would find a way that helps each individual person find a study technique that would not only keep the person wanting to learn, but also keep they consistent in learning and studying for major test such as the STAAR.
For me personally, the best feature would be something to keep me wantig to learn and stay productive and active within my studies. I personally would say i wouldn't use AI to study. I say this because I am someone who isn't good at studying in general, let alone stayong on top of work. I feel the only way I would be able to use AI to study is if there was a way to keep me hooked or interested in staying consistent with studying.

I am ready for summer to be out of school and hang out with friends. My main goal is to start college applications and work out more.

My thoughts on the new phone policy is that it isn't as bad as it originally seemed to be. I would like it if we could atleast use phones at lunch but during class I think it is a good thing.I have definitely been able to focus a lot more in class and have been able to keep myself ahead on my classes. A main benefit I have seen from it is students are more social and creative without the devices. Since we can't just be on our phones or have headphones on all day we are forced to socialize more with the people around us. I say overall while it would be nice to be on our phones at lunch, I think the phone ban is working out better than most people thought it would.

I want to pursue a career in nuerology within cognitive and behavorial within children. Computer science code and programs can influence this job in many different way. The main way being to help scan the brains and discover what each thing thats happening actually means and how it effects the child. Using the data collected from these codes and programs can be used to better help and understand what the child is going through. Over all, computer science and code will be a massive part is my future career.

The challenge that is described is to create a way that AI can be useful in real world experiences like education, medical reasons, and others. I think a good way that AI can help within education is helping the student understand why the answer for something they searched is that answer. When most students use AI to help answer something, they just scroll to the answer they need but dont actually learn anything. If a student would be ofrced to learn by answering questions and what they read in order to find thee actual answer they originally needed then it would help students learn while easily finding a certain answer. Along with this, this would help better develop students reading with getting snwers they need and would cause them to learn other things that could possible answer other questions thye might have had to search.
