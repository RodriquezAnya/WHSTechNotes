A game I enjoyed playing is Super Mario Party. I enjoy the battle between family or friends to roll higher and get farther on the gameboard. I liked the aspect of adding in mini games at the end of each round to compete between players. I also liked how some of the maps were based off of old nitendo games.

I think the main thing that was unclear was whether or not we were able to keep the file public or private and still have you able to check the journal.

A task that computer science comes into play in during my daily routine is waking up in the morning. The way I wake up every morning is by my alarm on my phone going off. By setting my alarm to go off at a certain time and make a certain noice is all created from a line of code built into the phone. With this code I am able to start my day on time and do what I need to.

A career pathway that interests me is cyber security. My main responsibilities would be to stop any attacks or threats towards my companies computer software and network. The main skills needed to work in cyber security is problem solving, adaptability, risk management, and critical thinking. The main education needed is a bachelor's degree in cyber security. This job aligns with my interests and goals due to the fact of wanting to improve my coding skills and also wanting to eventually be able to know how to easily solve problems.

Coding can improve problem solving skills due to the fact that in order to be good at coding, you must know what to do or how to fix any problems that happen in your code. This can be a useful skill because in life there are always problems that we face and need to know how to solve. Understanding coding can help in other pathways because of how many different types of skills that are useful in any job.

Ai is useful due to many different factors. One of the main factors is its ability to find solutions to many different types of problems. AI is able to find solutions for any type of problems and come up with more creative solutions that would take a whole team of people to come up with. This makes it easier to come up with solutions and solve problems faster.

Some potentials risk of AI is people overusing it. Ai is helpful in many ways so students may see it as an easy way to get work done with minimal effort. This can be harmful to a students ability to learn. This could also turn students to become lazy when it comes to school and not put in the work or effort they are capable of doing.

Technology has made food more affordable and accessable to the public due to how much more food can be grown at onced compared to if it was just people doing it on there own. With technology, we have the ability to plant more food and be able to harvest more at once, then deliver it to grocery stores. This makes it easier for the average public to be able to get the food they need to survive.

I think VR can impact and currently impacts people lives based on the different programs available to the public. With the many new developments in not only coding but with the different programs used withing VR, VR has impacted more people lives. The main example of this is with the different games or programs for working out or getting excercise. There are so many programs that make getting excersise easier to stay motivated and have fun with the workout. Something that excites me with VR is what else is to come to it and how much more it will impact our daily lives. An ethical consideration that would need to be addressed would be on whether having the headset on for so long is as good for our health as it is, even if we are using it for a program that helps you workout.
