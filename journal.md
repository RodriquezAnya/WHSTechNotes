A game I enjoyed playing is Super Mario Party. I enjoy the battle between family or friends to roll higher and get farther on the gameboard. I liked the aspect of adding in mini games at the end of each round to compete between players. I also liked how some of the maps were based off of old nitendo games.

I think the main thing that was unclear was whether or not we were able to keep the file public or private and still have you able to check the journal.

A task that computer science comes into play in during my daily routine is waking up in the morning. The way I wake up every morning is by my alarm on my phone going off. By setting my alarm to go off at a certain time and make a certain noice is all created from a line of code built into the phone. With this code I am able to start my day on time and do what I need to.

A career pathway that interests me is cyber security. My main responsibilities would be to stop any attacks or threats towards my companies computer software and network. The main skills needed to work in cyber security is problem solving, adaptability, risk management, and critical thinking. The main education needed is a bachelor's degree in cyber security. This job aligns with my interests and goals due to the fact of wanting to improve my coding skills and also wanting to eventually be able to know how to easily solve problems.

Coding can improve problem solving skills due to the fact that in order to be good at coding, you must know what to do or how to fix any problems that happen in your code. This can be a useful skill because in life there are always problems that we face and need to know how to solve. Understanding coding can help in other pathways because of how many different types of skills that are useful in any job.

Ai is useful due to many different factors. One of the main factors is its ability to find solutions to many different types of problems. AI is able to find solutions for any type of problems and come up with more creative solutions that would take a whole team of people to come up with. This makes it easier to come up with solutions and solve problems faster.

Some potentials risk of AI is people overusing it. Ai is helpful in many ways so students may see it as an easy way to get work done with minimal effort. This can be harmful to a students ability to learn. This could also turn students to become lazy when it comes to school and not put in the work or effort they are capable of doing.

Technology has made food more affordable and accessable to the public due to how much more food can be grown at onced compared to if it was just people doing it on there own. With technology, we have the ability to plant more food and be able to harvest more at once, then deliver it to grocery stores. This makes it easier for the average public to be able to get the food they need to survive.

I think VR can impact and currently impacts people lives based on the different programs available to the public. With the many new developments in not only coding but with the different programs used withing VR, VR has impacted more people lives. The main example of this is with the different games or programs for working out or getting excercise. There are so many programs that make getting excersise easier to stay motivated and have fun with the workout. Something that excites me with VR is what else is to come to it and how much more it will impact our daily lives. An ethical consideration that would need to be addressed would be on whether having the headset on for so long is as good for our health as it is, even if we are using it for a program that helps you workout.

Something I enjoyed from last semester was the lessons and the research I would do for the different journal entries. There isn't anything specific I would like to earn. I am not interested in any particular certification.

I think this shift could be a good or a bad thing. I do think AI will enhance productivity and enhance limits but could alsolimit them for AI being able to do more things than humans can. I would prepare myself to be able to be flexible with things changing.

I think the government uses this data collected by citizens to solve different nationwide problems as they see fit. They might also use the data within major brands and companies to see exact;y what consumers like. Both of these reasons are the main reason I believe that companies or the government should have access to peoples dats. Any other reason wouldnt be something I see as a prioity within having peoples data.
I think companies, such as tiktok, could continue running globally by creating more security measures. These measures would be to properly insure that peoples data arent being used in ways that we would not approve of. They can do this by creating some kind of system to ensure that the data the app has access to won't be spread around. This would also ensure that the app doesn't have any data that was not shared woth the app in the first place or that the consumer doesnt know about it.

Technology can provide safety and help in aviation when flying by doing many different things. A main way is with navigation especialy when finding a certain location or just traveling. Navigation helpps a pilot figure out where they need to go and how to get there. Having this technology not only makes a pilot job easier with finding the fastest way to get somehwere, but they can also use this to find the safeest way especially with the amount of fuel they have at once.
Another important way technology helps is communication while in the air. Being able to communicate with towers and the main control tower to find out if anything is affecting the travel pathway, and also weather. Knowing what is happening on land while being in the air can help ensure the safety of not only yourslef but the people on land as well. Making sure that there is a safe place to land and that something doesn't appeasr that you arent aware of appears in your travel path is important if you want to stay safe. The technology used to communicate between you and the people on land could be one of the most important pieces of technology available when traveling in the air.

Something interesting I learned is how music and movies can effect people in different ways. Certain songs can get people to go farther than they ever been before especially when running. Along with this certain movies can make people realize something they went through was not normal.
